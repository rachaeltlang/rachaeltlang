Hi! I'm a third-year computer science major with minors in data science and Chicano and Latino studies at the University of Wisconsin with a year of experience at Foxconn working closely with engineering and marketing professionals in developing technical documents for telecommunications products.

Coming from a multicultural background, I understand the importance of bridging the gap between people, both from personally and professionally. I know that my specialization in computer science, compounded with my strong background in writing, gives me a unique and refreshing take on topics in an ever-developing field.

In my spare time, I can often be found reading or ballroom dancing. As an aspiring computer scientist, I love solving problems, and I'm looking forward to a summer internship where I can further develop both my technical and soft skills.
