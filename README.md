## Hi! I'm Rachael (she/her)

I'm a computer science Master's student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a software engineer intern at Intel. I've also had two software engineering internship rotations at the J.M. Smucker Company and Target, where I've gained hands-on experience working on software development in a professional environment. On campus, I work as a supervisor at the IT Help Desk.

Coming from a multicultural background, I understand the importance of bridging the gap between people, both personally and professionally. I know that my specialization in computer science, compounded with my strong background in writing, gives me a unique and refreshing take on topics in an ever-developing field.

When Iâ€™m not busy Googling error messages, you can find me reading anything I can get my hands on or frantically knitting hats and scarves for Wisconsin winters. I love solving problems, and I'm looking forward to a 2024 summer internship where I can further develop my technical and soft skills.
