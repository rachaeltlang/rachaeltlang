Hi! I'm a computer science major with minors in data science and Chicano and Latino studies at the University of Wisconsin with two software engineering internship rotations at the J.M. Smucker Company and Target, where I've gained hands-on experience working on software development in a professional environment. I also have a year of experience at Foxconn working closely with engineering and marketing professionals in developing technical documents for telecommunications products.

Coming from a multicultural background, I understand the importance of bridging the gap between people, both personally and professionally. I know that my specialization in computer science, compounded with my strong background in writing, gives me a unique and refreshing take on topics in an ever-developing field.

In my spare time, I'm often reading, knitting, crocheting, or ballroom dancing. As an aspiring computer scientist, I love solving problems, and I'm looking forward to a 2024 summer internship where I can further develop my technical and soft skills.
